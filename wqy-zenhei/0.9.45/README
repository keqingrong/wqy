I. About this font

WenQuanYi Zen Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif) Chinese 
outline font. It is designed for general purpose text layout 
and on-screen display of Chinese characters and symbols from
many other languages. The emboldened strokes of the font glyphs 
produce enhanced screen contrast, making it easier to read and
recognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs, which can be enabled 
with the provided configuration files, further enhance the 
on-screen performance.

WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a fairly complete coverage to Chinese 
Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional forms. 
The total glyph number in this font is over 35,000, including over 
27,000 Chinese Hanzi. This font has full coverage CJK Unified 
Ideographs (U4E00-U9FC3) and CJK Extension A (U3400-U4DB5), 
as well as the code-points needed for zh_cn, zh_sg, zh_tw, 
zh_hk, zh_mo, ja (Japanese) and ko (Korean) locales. 
Starting from version 0.8, this font package has contained 
two font families, i.e. the proportionally-spaced Zen Hei, 
and a mono-spaced face named "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".

 IV. About WenQuanYi Project

Wen Quan Yi Project (spring of letters) was founded by 
Qianqian Fang[5] in Oct. 2004. The goal of this project 
is to develop CJK related open-source software and 
resources. The initial effots of the project focused 
on creating high quality bitmap character glyphs and 
outline fonts for all 70,000+ CJK characters currently 
encoded by the Unicode Consortium [4]. 

The contributors of the Wen Quan Yi Project use wiki[1] 
as the primary development tool for glyph creation, documentation
and coordinations. The Wen Quan Yi wiki (Habitat wiki: 
http://wenq.org/habitat/ ) was developed by Qianqian Fang
based on UseModWiki v1.0.

For commercial use, please contact the project
maintainer (Qianqian Fang) or consult copyright law firms to
make sure your plan is compliant with the font licenses.
