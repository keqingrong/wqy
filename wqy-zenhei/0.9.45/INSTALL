               Wen Quan Yi Zen Hei CJK Font

                  Installation Guide

----------------------------------------------------------

WenQuanYi Zen Hei font is a Chinese (or CJK) outline font 
with Hei-Ti style (a sans-serif style) Hanzi glyphs. This font
is developed for general purpose use of Chinese for formating,
printing and on-screen display. This font is also targeted at 
platform independence and the utility for document exchange
between various operating systems.

The installation process for this font on various systems will
be outlined below in this document.


Special Note: By default, we disabled the embedded bitmaps,
so that the characters will be displayed as Anti-aliased glyphs.
For those who want to use bitmap font rendering (for 9pt-12pt),
Please find the additional fontconfig file 66-wqy-zenhei-*.conf
in the installation package, and copy them to /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ 
You need to use "sudo" or change to root user to do the copy.

You can also find a command "zenheiset" in the package, install
it to /usr/bin/ with root permission, and then you can
type command

  sudo zenheiset aa

to display only the smooth vector glyphs, or 

  sudo zenheiset bitmap

to use the embedded Hanzi bitmaps, except the experimental 13px, or 

  sudo zenheiset bitmapfull

to use all available bitmaps.

If you do not have root/sudo permission, you can simply
merge the 66-* files and copy it to ~/.fonts.conf to 
enable the settings.

I.   Installation for GNU/Linux, Unix or BSD-like systems

The installation of this font on Linux/BSD type system is quite
straightforward if you are using the latest fontconfig/freetype2
libraries. Three types of packages were provided for this font:
Debian deb package, Redhat RPM package and generic tgz compression
format.

----------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Debian deb package

One-command installation is available for this font on Debian-based
systems. You can download the wqy-zenhei*.deb package and cd to the 
directory where the downloaded file locates, and type

    dpkg -i wqy-zenhei*.deb

where * is the actual version number. This will copy the font to
appropriate folders and set the configurations automatically.

to verify, after the installation, type 
    ls /usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-zenhei/
and see if this directory exists. You can also type
    fc-list | grep WenQuanYi
and see if you can see Zen Hei in the output

----------------------------------------------------------

2. Install Redhat RPM package

This is similar to the above case, you can simply type

    rpm -ivh wqy-zenhei*.rpm

to install and configure this font to your system
----------------------------------------------------------

3. Manual Installation with tgz package

If you are running BSD-type or Unix systems, you can install this
font manually.


3.1 Installation for all users

First, extract the font files with

   tar zxvf wqy-zenhei*.tar.gz

Then, change to root user, move the extracted folder, "wqy-zenhei" 
under /usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/ (If this dir does not exist, use 
mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/ to create it first.)

Then edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
and find the section with FontPath. Append 

   FontPath /usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-zenhei

under any of the FontPath line, save this file.

Then, if your system has /etc/fonts/fonts.conf, edit
it and append 

  <dir>/usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-zenhei/</dir>

before </fontconfig>

If your system are using fontconfig 2.4.x, move 44-wqy-zenhei.conf
in the extracted files to ~/.fonts.conf

Restart X server and you should be able to use this font.

2. Installation for single user

If you do not have root access, you can also install this font
by copying wqy-zenhei.ttc to ~/.fonts/  (If this folder
does not exist, create it first) and move 44-wqy-zenhei.conf to
~/.fonts.conf, then you can type fc-cache ~/.fonts/ to activate 
this font.

Alternatively, if you are running KDE/GNOME, you can use
the font installer tool from the preference dialog and install
this font.


========================================================== 
II.  Installation for Windows

To install this font on Windows is similar to any other true-type 
fonts: extract the wqy-zenhei.ttc file from the tar.gz package
and copy/paste it to c:\windows\fonts\ folder or c:\winnt\fonts\ folder.

If you have already installed an earlier version of this font, you
need to uninstall it before installing a new version.

We also provide a windows installer to automate the 
installation process. It is a self-executable file and simply
click and run.

========================================================== 
III.  Installation for Mac OS

Similar to Windows, download the tgz package and extract the ttc file,
double click on the ttc file on Finder, and click "Install".
